<h2>CMake, a scriptable build system</h2>
<p>
    Hello and Welcome to the CMake section.
    In this CMake section you will find mostly a combination of different technologies all coming together.
    You can think of CMake as a scripting language that describes how you want to build your project.
</p>
<p>Here is a short list of what CMake can do.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Generate cross-platform build files for various compilers (MSVC, GCC, Clang, etc.)</li>
    <li>Manage dependencies and third-party libraries</li>
    <li>Configure and control the build process with CMakeLists.txt</li>
    <li>Support multiple build systems (Makefiles, Ninja, Visual Studio projects, etc.)</li>
    <li>Enable out-of-source builds to keep source directories clean</li>
    <li>Integrate with package managers like Conan and vcpkg</li>
    <li>Handle complex project structures with subdirectories and modules</li>
    <li>Configure for Debug and Release</li>
    <li>Setup Test for TDD</li>
    <li>Create installers for the end user</li>
    <li>There are many builtin variables to easily configure your project</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an excerpt from the <a target="_blank" href="https://cmake.org">CMake</a> official site.</p>
<p>
    "CMake is the de-facto standard for building C++ code, with over 2 million downloads a month.
    It's a powerful, comprehensive solution for managing the software build process.
    Get everything you need to successfully leverage CMake by visiting our resources section."
</p>

<h2>Integration</h2>
<p>
    CMake is fully integrated into several code editors (such as VS-Code) and integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio.
    When it comes to <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS-Code</a> you can install the official CMake Extension <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools">CMake Extension</a>.
    The CMake extension will let you navigate the project's build structure with a graphical interface, create build configurations, set breakpoints and debug CMake scripts, and really its a long list of features.
</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>
    Of course, you should always check the <a target="_blank" href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest">Official CMake Docs</a> for detailed information.  
    But from a high-level perspective, CMake works by using configuration files called <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> within your project directory. These files are where you script your CMake commands.  
    You typically place one <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file in each directory of your project, with a main one at the root level, which serves as the entry point for the build configuration.
    The root level <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file is where you would set the CMake version requirements and define your main project.
</p>
<p>
    CMake is based around the concept of <b>targets</b>. A target is essentially an output unit of your build, such as an executable, a library, or even a test.  
    The first step is defining your project by calling <code>project()</code>, where you specify your project's name. This defines the "root" target for your project.  
    After that, you can create additional targets like **libraries** or **executables**, using commands such as <code>add_library()</code> and <code>add_executable()</code>.
</p>
<p>
    You can link these targets together using the <code>target_link_libraries()</code> command, allowing you to organize your project's structure and dependencies in a modular way.  
    CMake also provides various target types, such as **STATIC**, **SHARED**, or **INTERFACE** libraries, giving you the flexibility to build your project in different configurations.  
    In short, CMake allows you to build a project with various targets and link them in the most efficient and logical way for your needs.
</p>
<p>
    By using this structure, CMake enables a clean, flexible, and scalable build process that works across different platforms and compilers.
    This modularity also makes it easier to manage large projects with multiple dependencies.
</p>
