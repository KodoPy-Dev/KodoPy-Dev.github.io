<h2>CMake, a scriptable build system</h2>
<p>
    Hello and Welcome to the CMake section.
    In this CMake section you will find mostly a combination of different technologies all coming together.
    You can think of CMake as a scripting language that describes how you want to build your project.
</p>
<p>Here is a short list of what CMake can do.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Generate cross-platform build files for various compilers (MSVC, GCC, Clang, etc.)</li>
    <li>Manage dependencies and third-party libraries</li>
    <li>Configure and control the build process with CMakeLists.txt</li>
    <li>Support multiple build systems (Makefiles, Ninja, Visual Studio projects, etc.)</li>
    <li>Enable out-of-source builds to keep source directories clean</li>
    <li>Integrate with package managers like Conan and vcpkg</li>
    <li>Handle complex project structures with subdirectories and modules</li>
    <li>Configure for Debug and Release</li>
    <li>Setup Test for TDD</li>
    <li>Create installers for the end user</li>
    <li>There are many builtin variables to easily configure your project</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an excerpt from the <a target="_blank" href="https://cmake.org">CMake</a> official site.</p>
<p>
    "CMake is the de-facto standard for building C++ code, with over 2 million downloads a month.
    It's a powerful, comprehensive solution for managing the software build process.

<h2>Integration</h2>
<p>
    CMake is fully integrated into several code editors (such as VS-Code) and integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio.
    When it comes to <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS-Code</a> you can install the official CMake Extension <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools">CMake Extension</a>.
