<h2>CMake, a scriptable build system</h2>
<p>
    Hello and Welcome to the CMake section.
    In this CMake section you will find mostly a combination of different technologies all coming together.
    You can think of CMake as a scripting language that describes how you want to build your project.
</p>
<p>Here is a short list of what CMake can do.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Generate cross-platform build files for various compilers (MSVC, GCC, Clang, etc.)</li>
    <li>Manage dependencies and third-party libraries</li>
    <li>Configure and control the build process with CMakeLists.txt</li>
    <li>Support multiple build systems (Makefiles, Ninja, Visual Studio projects, etc.)</li>
    <li>Enable out-of-source builds to keep source directories clean</li>
    <li>Integrate with package managers like Conan and vcpkg</li>
    <li>Handle complex project structures with subdirectories and modules</li>
    <li>Configure for Debug and Release</li>
    <li>Setup Test for TDD</li>
    <li>Create installers for the end user</li>
    <li>There are many builtin variables to easily configure your project</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is an excerpt from the <a target="_blank" href="https://cmake.org">CMake</a> official site.</p>
<p>
    "CMake is the de-facto standard for building C++ code, with over 2 million downloads a month.
    It's a powerful, comprehensive solution for managing the software build process.
    Get everything you need to successfully leverage CMake by visiting our resources section."
</p>

<h2>Integration</h2>
<p>
    CMake is fully integrated into several code editors (such as VS-Code) and integrated development environments (IDEs) like Visual Studio.
    When it comes to <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VS-Code</a> you can install the official CMake Extension <a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cmake-tools">CMake Extension</a>.
    The CMake extension will let you navigate the project's build structure with a graphical interface, create build configurations, set breakpoints and debug CMake scripts, and really its a long list of features.
</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<p>
    Of course, you should always check the <a target="_blank" href="https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest">Official CMake Docs</a> for detailed information.  
    But from a high-level perspective, CMake works by using configuration files called <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> within your project directory. These files are where you script your CMake commands.  
    You typically place one <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file in each directory of your project, with a main one at the root level, which serves as the entry point for the build configuration.
    The root level <code>CMakeLists.txt</code> file is where you would set the CMake version requirements and define your main project.
</p>
<p>
    CMake is based around the concept of <b>targets</b>. A target is essentially an output unit of your build, such as an executable, a library, or even a test.  
    The first step is defining your project by calling <code>project()</code>, where you specify your project's name. This defines the "root" target for your project.  
    After that, you can create additional targets like **libraries** or **executables**, using commands such as <code>add_library()</code> and <code>add_executable()</code>.
</p>
<p>
    You can link these targets together using the <code>target_link_libraries()</code> command, allowing you to organize your project's structure and dependencies in a modular way.  
    CMake also provides various target types, such as **STATIC**, **SHARED**, or **INTERFACE** libraries, giving you the flexibility to build your project in different configurations.  
    In short, CMake allows you to build a project with various targets and link them in the most efficient and logical way for your needs.
</p>
<p>
    By using this structure, CMake enables a clean, flexible, and scalable build process that works across different platforms and compilers.
    This modularity also makes it easier to manage large projects with multiple dependencies.
</p>

<h2>Tooling</h2>
<p>
    Use the links below to get CMake, VS-Code, Git, GitHub Desktop, and to make your github account.
    CMake and Git might have a lot of installer options, just select standard choices and everything will be okay for our purposes.
</p>
<b>You will also need to get a compiler too, check the compiler section below after this!</b>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://cmake.org">CMake</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com">Visual Studio Code</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://git-scm.com">Git</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com">GitHub (Make an account here if you want one)</a></li>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apps/desktop">GitHub Desktop</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Here are the extensions for VS-Code that I use. Just open the extensions section in VS-Code and search for the ID name.</p>
<p>(CRTL + SHIFT + X) This will open the extension section in VS-Code.</p>
<ul>
    <li><a target="_blank" href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack">ID = ms-vscode.cpptools-extension-pack</a></li>

</ul>

<h2>C++ Compilers</h2>
<p>
    Okay, now that you have CMake and Visual Studio Code, you will need to get a C++ Compiler.
    There are many options and various ways to obtain compilers.
    For Windows, a good C++ compiler can be obtained by downloading Visual Studio, and NO, its not VS-Code.
    Visual Studio has a free version called community edition, so download that one if needed.
    While installing Visual Studio, make sure you select the C++ Desktop Development Workload.
    You can always change this later if needed. You simply can run the installer again and it will let you modify and add more workloads.
    For Linux, most of the distros already come with compilers, and for Mac, you may also already have one, either way they options are listed below.
</p>

<b>This is not a full list of compilers, feel free to look around, however, these are popular choices and among the best.</b>
