<h2>Editors</h2>
<p>
    Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is one of the easiest and most popular choices for Python development today.
    It offers many free extensions that enhance Python support within the editor.
    Another option (but more as a side companion) is Jupyter Notebooks, a web-based interface for Python that allows running code in isolated blocks rather than executing an entire script.
    VS Code also supports Jupyter Notebooks through an extension, enabling the same functionality within the editor.
    Jupyter Notebooks are particularly useful for fast iteration and interactive coding.
    Watching some tutorial videos can help give you an idea for the differences but essentially you might prefer using both.

<h2>Python Distributions</h2>
<p>
    Some applications embed a Python interpreter within their source code, meaning you may not need to install Python separately on your machine.
    Blender is a good example of an application that embeds a python interpreter into its build.
    However, it's still a good idea to install Python separately, as your code editor will likely require it for IntelliSense and debugging.

    When installing python, make sure to enable "Add Python to PATH" option.
    This ensures the system paths will include python.

    For Windows, you can check this by opening command prompt and typing python.
    It should show start the interactive python interpreter within command prompt if succsessful.
    You can also type "echo %PATH%" into command prompt to see if python is in the system paths.
