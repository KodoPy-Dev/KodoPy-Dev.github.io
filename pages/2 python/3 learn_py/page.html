<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the Learn Python section!
    In this tutorial, I'll guide you through the basics to get you up and running with Python.
    Before we start, ensure you have two things ready, a code editor (like VS Code or PyCharm) and Python installed on your computer.
    If you need help with installation, check out the <a target="_blank" href="python_software.html">Python Software Section</a>.

<h2>Part 1 - Understanding the Python Interpreter</h2>
<p>
    Before we jump into writing code, let's take a quick look at how Python works behind the scenes.
    This will help you understand what happens when you run your programs.
    The key player here is the <strong>Python Interpreter</strong>, the program that reads and executes your Python code.
</p>
<p>
    On my Windows machine, for example, the interpreter is located at:
</p>
<code class="highlight">C:\Users\kodopy\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe</code>
<p>
    When you write Python code, you'll save it in a file with a <code class="highlight">.py</code> extension (e.g., <code class="highlight">script.py</code>).
    This extension tells your operating system that it's a Python file and allows the interpreter to recognize it.
    To run this file, you'll use a terminal (like Command Prompt on Windows or Terminal on macOS/Linux) and provide two pieces of information: the path to the Python interpreter and the path to your <code class="highlight">.py</code> file.
</p>
<p>Here's an example command:</p>
<code class="highlight">C:\Users\kodopy> python C:\script.py</code>
<p>Let's break this command into its two main parts:</p>
<ol>
    <li><code class="highlight">python</code></li>
    <p>
        This is the command to launch the Python interpreter.
        If your system's environment variables (like PATH) include the directory where <code class="highlight">python.exe</code> is stored, typing <code class="highlight">python</code> is enough to start it.
        If this doesn't work on your machine, it means the path isn't set up yet. See the <a target="_blank" href="python_software.html">Software Section</a> for instructions on how to fix this.
        Essentially, this part just tells your computer to run the Python program.
    </p>
    <li><code class="highlight">C:\script.py</code></li>
    <p>
        This is the path to your Python file.
        After launching the interpreter with <code class="highlight">python</code>, you pass the file path as an argument.
        The interpreter then locates your file and starts executing the code inside it.
    </p>
</ol>
<p>
    The diagram below illustrates how the Python interpreter processes your <code class="highlight">.py</code> file:
