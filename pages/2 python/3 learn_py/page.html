<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Welcome to the Learn Python section.
    Here I will try to get you up and running with Python.
    Before you begin, make sure you have a code editor and python installed.

<h2>Part 1 - Interpretation</h2>
<p>
    Before diving into the code, let's take a quick glance under the hood.
    This will give us a better understanding as to what is happening.
    To investigate the mechanisms, let's turn our attention to the main application, the Python Interpreter.
</p>
<p>For me, on my windows machine, the path is</p>
<code class="highlight">C:\Users\kodopy\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe</code>
<p>
    When you create a source code file for python, you will end the python file with the <code class="highlight">.py</code> file extension.
    This lets your operating system make file associations and is the correct file type for the interpreter to recognize it.
    When you want to run the python file, you will use a terminal to start the process.
    In the terminal you will give your system the path to the python interpreter followed by the source code file path.
</p>
<p>Example</p>
<code class="highlight">C:\Users\kodopy>python C:\script.py</code>

<p>
    So what did that just do?
    Well, if you set up your system paths to recognize python, typing python into the terminal will essentially just go and lookup the full path for you.
    But what this does is tells your operating system to load python.
    The next aspect of the command are the arguments that you pass into python.
    In this case we passed in the script's file path.
    So when the python interpreter begins running, it will actually see that path you passed in.
