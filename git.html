<h2>GitHub</h2>
<p>As always, the official <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com">GitHub Docs</a> is the best resource to explore all topics in depth.</p>
<p>
    GitHub is an online service that allows you to host your repositories on a remote server.
    It offers both free and paid plans, with the free version offering plenty of features to work without any real hiccups.
</p>
<p>
    While you work locally on your computer, the Git application tracks all changes in your repository.
    Once you're ready to push your updates, you can send them to GitHub, keeping your branch in sync.
    But GitHub is much more than just a remote backup of your project.
</p>
<p>
    GitHub allows multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously.
    It includes a fully programmable Actions system to automate tasks based on specific events.
    You can also create REST APIs for your repositories, edit and view code online from anywhere, and safeguard your project against hard drive failures.
</p>
<p>
    Even with the free version, you can create both public and private repositories.
    And now, GitHub offers <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/about-github-copilot/what-is-github-copilot">Copilot</a>, an AI-powered coding companion that helps boost productivity as you code.
</p>
<p>
    Additionally, you can turn a repository into a website, just like this KodoPy Docs site!
    If you're interested, check out the <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/quickstart">GitHub Pages Guide</a>.
</p>
<p>
    The list of features goes on, and GitHub is always evolving.
    It may take time to explore everything it can do, but just try to not get stuck in all the minute details.
    Instead, learn what exists and what the features can do (high-level), and only get into the nitty-gritty details when you need it for your project.
    Chances are, you wont need every possible feature, so, just take a peek and move on if you don't need it! Just like speed shopping!
</p>

<h2>GitHub Desktop</h2>
<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/apps/desktop">GitHub Desktop</a> provides a graphical user interface (GUI) to perform common Git operations, such as cloning repositories, committing changes, managing branches, and syncing with remote repositories, without needing to memorize or type Git commands.
    I would say that using the GUI version of Git seems like cheating or something but it isn't.
    If you like it, use it, thats why it's there.
    It is <b>NOT</b> tailored to beginners, a lot of professionals use it because it's fast, powerful, and lets you see everything that is happening.
    (Not trying to undermine Git and the command line, for me all tools have their place and purpose)
</p>
<p>
    I've included the diagram below so you can see how Git and GitHub Desktop work together on the client side (that's you).
    At some point you will then use GitHub Desktop to push your changes to the cloud and off it goes!
    The ISP will route your data to the GitHub servers where it will be uploaded to your online "Remotely Hosted" repository.
    Note the two way arrows, GitHub Desktop can also pull down changes from your remote host as well, and then you can merge the remote changes into your local project.
    This would be the case if you are working with some friends on a project and they push changes to the remote repository, once they do that you would then pull their updates down into your project.
